# Pokedex C++ Project

This is a C++ project that I made in spring 2025 in my ICS 212 Programming Structure class that allows the user to get information from a catalogue of pokemon. In this project there was a base class called Pokemon with derived classes to represent different types of pokemon.

From this project I learned to apply Object-Oriented Programming by creating an inheritance hierarchy where Pokemon was the parent class. I also learned to implement polymorphism by overriding printData() from the parent class in the child class. I also dynamically managed memory with new and delete to allocate and deallocate memory in order to prevent memory leaks.

I was responsible for the entire project where I created all of the header and source code files, created the interface for all of the object, and created the child classes that contained their respective data. 

Here is the project: <a href="https://github.com/KateHamada/Pokedex.git">Pokedex</a>
