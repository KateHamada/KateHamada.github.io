TCP Header Responder C++ Project

[CHANGE THIS] This bank database is a C++ project that I created in ICS 212, spring 2025. This project helped me learn to manage data as well as how pointers work by using a linked list to store the account number, name, and amount of money in a separate file. This was implemented on PUTTY but was created in Visual Studio Code in about a month. 

Here is the project: <a href="hhttps://github.com/KateHamada/TCP-Header-Responder.git">TCP Header Responder</a>
