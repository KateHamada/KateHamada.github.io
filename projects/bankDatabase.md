Bank Database C++ Project

  This project is a C++ project that I created in ICS 212 programming structure in spring 2025 that manages data for bank records. There was also a C version I made but this one is more thorough in my opnion. This project has a user-interface that allows a user to manage customer bank records, which contained an account number, a name, and an address. The records are stored in a linked list after reading a file to store it if the user closes the program and wants to look at the records later. Some of it's features include: adding new records, printing all records, finding a specific record, and quiting the program.

  I was the sole developer of this project and my responsibilities were development, implementation, debugging, error handling, as well as documenting. I planned out how to handle the user interface as well as handling the data in the file so that it's formatted correctly into a linked list. I wrote all of the code that implemented the functions that the user can call. I also created and used a debug mode to test and make sure that my code handled all possible user errors and make sure everything goes smoothly. I also included pretty thorough comments so that if someone wanted to expand on this project or use it themselves could understand what's happening.

  This project helped me learn about dynamic memory allocation using linked lists with pointers as well s deallocation when creating and implementing delete so that there aren't memory leaks. This project also helped me learn Object-Oriented Programming by implementing a class with member functions and data members. I also learned how to overload the assignment, copy, and stream insertion operator. In additon to that I learned how to hand user input and file input/output in order for the user to access the records even after they leave the program.
