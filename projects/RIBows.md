This project is a HTML, CSS, and Typescript project that me and a couple other of my classmates created in ICS 314 Software Engineering in Fall 2026. This project allows users to search directly for an RIO that they want to join, as well as filters like trending and type of RIO. This program also allows clubs to have their own account and edit their own information in case the spreadsheet that the database is using has any incorrect or not up to date information. 

I worked on this project with Gerric Abe, Tyler Jordan Acasio, Charles Brown III, and Ethan Chiu but what I did contribute was typically for admin privileges as well as playwright tests for Continuous Integration.

Somethings I learned from this project was how to pull information from a database, in this case a Neon POSTGRES SQL. I also learned how to restrict users so that only admin can edit, add, and delete RIO's. I also learned how to implement continuous integrations with Playwright tests that would run every time you would merge into main.
