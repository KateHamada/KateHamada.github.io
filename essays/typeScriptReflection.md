## My View on Typescript
I don’t have much thoughts on Typescript so far because I feel like it’s pretty similar to javascript just with a couple of differences. I will say it’s been a while since I’ve used javascript and I’ve as of recent have only really used C and C++ so the adjustment of not having to declare the type where “const” and “let” go is a little disorientating sometimes and other small syntax differences trip me up here and there but it’s not overall that different than the other languages that I’ve learned. I don’t really know if Typescript would be a good or bad programming language from a software perspective because I feel like languages don’t have enough of a difference to make them good or bad. In addition to that I feel like I haven’t dealt with a big enough project to be able to tell the major differences between languages. I also feel like the way that people code and how they choose to format their code is what makes more of a difference when it comes to readability and being able to work together on a project. 

## Thoughts on Athletic Software Engineering
I found the practice WODs to be useful because it made me realize how much I rely on AI to help me code anything. Even though I know what I want to do, in the sense I can structure the code to solve the problem, I typically have a problem with syntax and what I can or cannot do. I think this style of learning will definitely help me to be able to do interviews better and to be more confident in my knowledge of coding because I have a tendency to freeze up and blank. I do think that it is stressful because of the time limit, if there wasn’t a time limit then I wouldn’t be as stressed because I know that I would be able to figure it out eventually without using AI. However the only way that I’ve been able to make the time is if I use AI because of how slow I am to code but I think it’s because there’s just so many different ways that I can go about achieving the same output with different loops or recursion that I just start to overthink it. I’m not too sure if this will work for me yet but I do think that it’s worth a try and that I don’t think it could hurt me.
