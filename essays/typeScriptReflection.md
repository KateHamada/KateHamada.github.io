## My View on Typescript
There wasn’t much that stuck out to me while using typescript mostly because it’s pretty similar to javascript just with a couple of differences. Even though it’s been a while since I’ve used javascript and have only really used C and C++ as of late, the adjustment of not having to declare the type of variable and instead use “const” and “let” is a little disorientating sometimes and other small syntax differences trip me up here and there but it’s not overall that different than the other languages that I’ve learned. It’s uncertain whether or not typescript would be a good or bad programming language from a software perspective because in my opinion languages don’t have enough of a difference to make them good or bad. In addition to that I haven’t dealt with a big enough project to be able to tell the major differences between languages. To further my point, in my opinion, the way that people code and how they choose to format their code is what makes more of a difference when it comes to readability and being able to work together on a project rather than the language itself. 

## Thoughts on Athletic Software Engineering
I found the practice WODs to be useful because it made me realize how much I rely on AI to help me code anything. Even though I know what I want to do, in the sense I can structure the code to solve the problem in pseudo code, I typically have a problem with syntax and what I can or cannot do in typescript. This style of learning will definitely help me to be able to do technical interviews better and to be more confident in my knowledge of coding because I have a tendency to freeze up and blank. This style of learning is stressful because of the time limit since I overcomplicate everything. So the only way that I’ve been able to make the time is if I use AI because of how slow I code but I think it’s because there’s just so many different ways that I can go about achieving the same output with different loops or recursion that I just start to overthink it. It’s hard to tell yet if this will work for me but I do think that it’s worth a try and that I don’t think it could hurt me.
