## *The Joy of Building User-Focused Software*

Some of the things that I like about software engineering is that there’s a lot more creativity involved in the sense that you’re creating something and having to think about where things should go and what they should look like. When I began my coding journey in my junior year of high school, I noticed that the part that I enjoyed the most was designing a user interface that was pretty and functional. I also think that it’s pretty cool that in concept we’re building something that people could actually use and then eventually build on top of something that people actually use. I’m not going to lie, when I use apps like Spotify or YouTube or TikTok, I do start thinking about how things could be improved from a user’s perspective and how to fix it even though I can’t do anything about it. Don’t get me wrong, I would love to work for a big company like Spotify or YouTube and to be able to have some kind of input on the design and implementation of their apps. However I highly doubt I would be able to get those kinds of jobs because of how competitive they are and being able to secure a job is more important to me than where I work after graduating. 

## Developing Skills for Large-Scale Systems

I have already experienced some of what software engineering is because you learn to design apps in AP Computer Science in high school, however it was pretty basic. But I do hope to be able to expand on my knowledge on large scale software design because I don’t really know how to approach it and it just seems overwhelming. I also hope to learn how I can implement AI in order to make software engineering more efficient. Even if I don’t end up working in the software engineering industry, the skills I will learn in my Software Engineering I class will be able to help me so I’m eager to learn as much as I can. 

## From Data to Insight: A Future in Data Analysis

One of the industries that I’m interested in pursuing is data analysis or data science and one of the key components that I’m excited to learn is to be able to turn the data that I receive and turn it into something understandable by the people I could be working for. The reason why I’m excited to learn this is because I like being able to turn things, in this case data, into something that anyone can understand, basically making it more accessible. So I hope in some capacity that this class will help me learn how to make things readable and to improve my problem solving skills in order to do that.
