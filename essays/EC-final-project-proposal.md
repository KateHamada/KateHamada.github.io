## Overview
<i>The problem:</i> 
Students that are 21+ don’t know where to start when trying to find bars or places to drink near Manoa. For example do they want to drink somewhere that’s on the quieter and relaxed side or do they want to drink somewhere that’s loud and everyone’s dancing. In addition to that they might want to consider the prices of these places and parking. 

<i>The solution:</i>
Bar Crawler U is a website that allows you to log in and then determine where the user (student) should go to drink alcohol. This is based on what kind of alcohol they’re wanting to drink, their price range, location, parking, and the atmosphere of the place. The website will also show places that are trending this week that people have been going to and are highly rated.

## Approach
The approach for Bar Crawler U will focus on helping students discover and explore bars that fit their preferences. The website will feature a clean landing page that introduces the concept and encourages users to create an account. Once logged in, users will be taken to their home page where they can filter or search for bars based on criteria such as price range, type of drinks served, parking availability, and atmosphere (for example, chill, energetic, or upscale). If a bar isn’t listed, users can request for it to be added through a submission form, which the admin can review and approve. The admin dashboard will allow for managing bar listings—adding, editing, or deleting entries as needed. Users will also be able to see trending and popular bars based on weekly activity and ratings. Each individual bar page will display details like the name, address, drink selection, price range, parking rating, and overall vibe of the place

## Use case ideas
- New user goes to the landing page; creates an account; edits profile; logs in; gets served the user home page; filters based on price, drink type, atmosphere, location, parking, etc.
- Admin goes to the landing page; logs in; gets served the admin home page; edits bars, users

## Beyond the basics
- Supports local and new bars near Manoa.
- Gives UH students ideas for where to go out based on their budget, drink preferences, and mood.
- Promotes local nightlife spots and helps them gain visibility.
- Allows UH students to rate and review bars.
