# Overview
<i>The problem:</i> 
- Students that are 21+ don’t know where to start when trying to find bars or places to drink. For example do they want to drink somewhere that’s on the quieter and relaxed side or do they want to drink somewhere that’s loud and everyone’s dancing.

<i>The solution:</i>
- [Restaurant Recs] is a website designed to suit every user's unique palette. The website will show all restaurants available within the user's location, but will default the location to UH Manoa. It will also filter restaurants based on cuisine, the user’s taste, and price range. As well as determine the popular or trending restaurants of the week.

# Mockup page ideas
- Landing page
- User home page 
- Request a Restaurant
If the restaurant is not displayed in the list, form page to request it be added
Admin home page
adds restaurant
edit restaurant information details
Delete restaurant
Filter / Search Page
All restaurants (Default)
Filter

Search To My Taste! (only shows cuisine that the user specified on profile)
Price ranges (i.e. $15-$20)
I’m feeling lucky
Popular Restaurant / Trending Restaurant
Individual Restaurant Page

# Use case ideas
- New user goes to the landing page; creates an account; edits profile; logs in; gets served the user home page; filters based on price, food type, open hours, location, parking, etc.
- Admin goes to the landing page; logs in; gets served the admin home page; edits restaurants, users

# Beyond the basics
Supports local, mom and pop restaurants, new restaurants, etc.
Gives UH students ideas for food based on their budget and taste
Uplifts restaurants and gives them more service 
Allows UH students to rate food
