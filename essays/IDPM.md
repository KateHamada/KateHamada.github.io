## Estimations
I made my effort estimates based on how long it took me to do the WOD’s or at least a part of some of the WOD’s as I wasn’t building the whole website from scratch just parts of it. Eventually once it got to week 2 of doing the project, I was also able to better estimate how long it would take for me to complete some tasks.


### Benefits
Estimating in advance helped me allocate a bare minimum amount of time that I should be spending on the part of the project that I was working on so that it would get done. For example, even though I underestimated how long it would take to connect the edit Rio page to the database, I usually allocated an extra hour or two in case it would take longer than the estimate so that I was able to complete it before the milestone.

### Useful or Not?
I found the tracking actual effort useful in order to give a better time frame as to how long we would actually have to spend on the project in order to get it done because it didn’t seem like it would take long in the beginning until we got to more complex issues that took longer. These estimates also helped us determine what was doable for this project while keeping functionality in mind.

## Tracking Method
I made my effort estimates with an app/website called [Toggl Track](https://track.toggl.com/timer) and I believe that my tracking was pretty accurate but I may have undertracked how long I took on some issues as I would forget to start the timer. 

## Improvements
I think I would want to include something that would remind me to start a timer as soon as I open up github or vscode because starting the timer would always be a problem. It might have been easier to use Wakatime as that would remove the need to remember to start a timer.
